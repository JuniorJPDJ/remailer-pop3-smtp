# Simple remailer (mailing list)

## What to use it for?
If you want some people to get mails sent to one mail - just use it.

Example:
* When you study at college and want lecturer to sent something to whole group.

## What do I need to use it?
Mail account with pop3 and smtp support (nearly every provider?)

## How to use it?

Just rename config.yaml.example to config.yaml and fill it with own data.
Then you can just run it or use it with docker.
